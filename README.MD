## General data considerations
Please visit https://erviss.org/ for a detailed description of the underlying data (see 'Methods' in the footer). 

All data are subject to continuous verification and may change based on retrospective updates in order to accurately reflect trends, changes in national case definitions, and/or reporting practices. Caution should be used when comparing published data longitudinally.

Case definitions, testing strategies, reporting practices, and lag times (e.g. time to case notification and time to reporting of deaths) differ between countries. These factors, among others, influence the data presented and may lead to misinterpretation.

## Note on ILI and ARI consultation rate data

ILI and ARI consultation rates are calculated per 100 000 population, except for Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta (per 100 consultations) and Finland (per 100 000 consultations).
